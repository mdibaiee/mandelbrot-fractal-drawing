The Mandelbrot Set's Fractal Shape
==================================

I was drifting to sleep when it just hit me, as it always does: "how are fractal shapes drawn anyway"?
So I just looked it up and found out the wikipedia page on [The Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)

Here is a simple working rendering of the Mandelbrot set using HTML5 Canvas.
I wanted to write the recursion as well (zooming in indefinitely), but was not in the mood really, maybe sometime later.
